# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on identifying meaningful customer segments using **RFM Analysis** and **Machine Learning**. Customer segmentation allows businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction by understanding customer behavior and preferences. The analysis uses the Superstore dataset as its foundation.

## Objectives
1. **RFM Analysis**: Perform Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis to identify customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
2. **Machine Learning**: Apply machine learning algorithms (Kmeans) to further refine and automate the segmentation process. 

## Dataset
The project uses the [**Superstore Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final), which contains information about transactions, customers, and products. Key features include:
- **Transaction Date**: Used to calculate recency.
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Order ID**: Identifies individual transactions.
- **Sales Amount**: Monetary value of transactions.
- **Other Features**: Product categories, regions, etc., that may be used in machine learning.

## Methods

### 1. RFM Analysis
RFM analysis is a data-driven segmentation method based on three metrics:
- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency**: How often a customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary**: How much money a customer spends.

Steps:
1. Calculate RFM metrics for each customer.
2. Assign scores to Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.
3. Group customers into segments based on their RFM scores.

### 2. Machine Learning for Segmentation
Machine learning is used to automate and refine segmentation beyond RFM analysis. The workflow includes:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset.
   - Visualize patterns and relationships.
   - Select relevant features for clustering.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Use RFM metrics and additional features from the dataset.
   - Normalize or scale data if necessary.

3. **Clustering Algorithm**:
   - Apply clustering using **K-Means** algorithms.
   - Evaluate clustering results using metrics like silhouette score and inertia.

4. **Insights & Recommendations**:
   - Interpret cluster characteristics.
   - Provide actionable insights based on the customer segments.

## Results
Results will include:
1. Key customer segments identified through RFM analysis.

    The key customer segments were derived using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, which provided an understanding of customer behavior based on how recently they made a purchase, how often they make purchases, and how much money they spend.
2. Clusters generated by machine learning algorithms.
    The data was clustered using a machine learning algorithm, revealing four distinct customer segments:
    - Top Customers:
        - Characteristics: Very loyal, frequent transactions, tend to make large purchases, and actively use discounts.
        - Potential: These customers represent the highest value for the business due to their loyalty and purchasing behavior.
    - High Value Customers:
        - Characteristics: Frequently make transactions, and while they haven't reached the "top customer" level, they show strong potential to do so.
        - Potential: This group can be nurtured to become "top customers" with the right incentives or engagement strategies.
    - Medium Value Customers (Cluster 1)
        - Characteristics: Moderate frequency of transactions, representing a middle-ground value for the business.
        - Potential: This group can be retained and possibly upgraded with targeted marketing or offers.
    - Low Value Customers (Cluster 3):
        - Characteristics: Rarely make transactions and show a high potential for churn.
        - Potential: Immediate action is needed to engage or retain these customers, as they are at risk of leaving without intervention.
